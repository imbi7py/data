Over time the app grows and we add more bells and whistles, like a search functionality via ElasticSearch. Soon we notice that we need a cache too.\n\nNow we have a fairly complex application and a completely new set of problems like the cache invalidation, stale data, consistency issues etc.\n\nWhat if I said that using logs would help you here? This talk looks into using Kafka via Python to build solid data structures.\n\nOverview of the talk outline is:\n\n* Description of the problem\n* What are log based data structures\n* What's Kafka and why is it amazing?\n* Using Kafka via Python\n* Demo time!\n\n\nAbout the author:  I'm a content engineer at the music streaming company Spotify. I've been using Python for professional and personal projects for over 10 years now. Over the course of years I've built open-source tools for Python and even contributed to the cpython itself.\n\nI have also been a part of creating both PyCon Finland and PyCon Sweden. I'm also organising the PySthlm meetups in Stockholm.",

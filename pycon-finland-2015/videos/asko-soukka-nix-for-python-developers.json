  "description": "PyCon Finland 2015\nAsko Soukka - Nix for Python developers\n\nWhat do you do when your python project has dependencies beyond Python? Nix is a \"purely functional\" package manager, which can also be used like \"virtualenv\", but for everything. I would cover single user installation of Nix package manager on Linux or Mac, defining Nix based development environments, generating Nix expressions for large Python projects using buildout, and finally, building minimal Docker images from SCRATCH by using those generated expressions.\n\nAbout the author:  I'm a system designer at University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and core contributor for a Python based open source CMS called Plone. I have blogged about my topics at https://datakurre.pandala.org/",

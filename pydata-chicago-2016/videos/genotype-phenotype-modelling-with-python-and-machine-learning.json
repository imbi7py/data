  "description": "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nGenotype-phenotype studies are done for predicting traits such as whether someone will go bald or have a particular disease given their only genome. We look at how Python libraries such as scikit-learn and keras have made it easier to develop these statistical models. We describe a pipeline to predict antimicrobial resistance in bacteria and elaborate on challenges when working with genomic data.",

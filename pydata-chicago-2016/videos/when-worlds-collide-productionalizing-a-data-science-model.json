  "description": "PyData Chicago 2016\n\nOn our first data science project at Shiftgig, the data science and engineering teams had to build software that was production-ready while maintaining the flexibility of a data science sandbox. Although these seem like irreconcilable goals, they forced us to improve inter-team communication and ultimately helped create a great product. We\u2019ll walk through our process and the lessons we learned.",

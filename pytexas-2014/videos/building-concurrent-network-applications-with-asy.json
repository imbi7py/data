  "description": "In this talk, I'll introduce the ``asyncio`` module, which was recently\nadded to the Python standard library. I'll talk about the problems that\ncan be solved with asynchronous I/O and will show how the tools provided\nby the module, including event loops, coroutines, and futures, along\nwith Python's new ``yield from`` syntax, can be used to build a\nconcurrent network application.\n",

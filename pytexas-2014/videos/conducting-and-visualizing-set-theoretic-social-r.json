  "description": "In this talk, I will discuss a suite of F/OSS programs (Python/Qt) that\nI have developed for conducting \"qualitative comparative analysis,\" a\nsocial research technique for analyzing subset relationships. (For\nexample, religious fundamentalists constitute a rough subset of\npolitical conservatives: most religious fundamentalists are politically\nconservative but most conservatives aren't religious fundamentalists.)\n\nThe talk will review the process of developing the software, beginning\nwith an R implementation that was ultimately discarded, and outline why\nI ended up choosing Python and review the consequences of that choice,\nboth pro and con. I will also discuss my current work on developing new\ntechniques for visualizing subset relationships, including different\napproaches to presenting Venn and Euler diagrams. More generally, I'll\nassess benefits and disadvantages of using Python for developing\nacademic software.\n",

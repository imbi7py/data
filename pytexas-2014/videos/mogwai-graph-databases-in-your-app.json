  "description": "Graph Databases can be very powerful when used correctly, unfortunately\nthe landscape is still very young, let alone finding a python library to\ninterface with your database. Here we will cover Titan (a highly\nscalable graph database) and Mogwai (a python OGM, maintained by me) to\ninterface with the database in an intuitive and easy fashion.\n\nWe'll very quickly cover the concept of graph databases, and interacting\nwith Titan via the Gremlin REPL. Following that we'll go headstrong into\nworking with Mogwai and create a simple web API.\n\nhttp://mogwai.readthedocs.org/ http://bitbucket.org/wellaware/mogwai\n",

  "description": "What are generators and coroutines in Python? What additional\nconceptualisations do they offer, and how can we use them to better\nmodel problems? It's an intermediate-level talk around the core concept\nof generators with a lot of examples of not only neat things you can do\nwith generators but also new ways to model and conceptualise problems.\n\nGenerators are one of the most notable features of Python, and they are\na critical component of Python 3's driving focus on iterability as a\ncore protocol. This talk introduces the basic concepts surrounding\ngenerators, generator expressions, and co-routines, then dives into ways\nthat generators can improve our code: not just in terms of performance\nbut also by offering us better ways to model our problems.\n",

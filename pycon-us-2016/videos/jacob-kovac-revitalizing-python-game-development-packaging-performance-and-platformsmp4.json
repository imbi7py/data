  "description": "Speaker: Jacob Kovac\n\nWith the advent of mobile platforms, as well as the prevalence of the GPU, Python has fallen almost entirely out of favor with game developers. However, there are some exciting solutions to the major issues being built on top of the Kivy GUI Framework. This talk will cover the recent developments that make it possible to build high quality, cross-platform games in Python.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",

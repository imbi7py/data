  "description": "Speakers: Julia Ferraioli, Amy Unruh, Eli Bixby\n\nMachine learning can be an intimidating subject. In this session, we\u2019ll get practical, hands-on experience with core concepts in machine learning with TensorFlow, an open source deep learning library. We\u2019ll introduce the basics of TensorFlow, including how to ingest and prepare raw data for use, run a variety of algorithms to gain insight from the data, and have some fun with visualization.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",

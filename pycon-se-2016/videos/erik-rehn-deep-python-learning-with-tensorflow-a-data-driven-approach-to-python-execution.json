  "description": "Is it possible to train a neural network to execute Python scripts?\n\nData-driven algorithm learning is a growing field of research. In this talk we will take a look at Google\u2019s new deep learning library Tensorflow, and implement a basic model that can be taught how to execute simple Python scripts.",

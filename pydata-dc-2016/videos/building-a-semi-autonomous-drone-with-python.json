  "description": "PyData DC 2016\n\nThey might not be delivering our mail (or our burritos--tacocopter.com) yet but drones are now simple, small, and affordable enough that they can be considered a toy. You can even customize and program some of them! The Parrot AR Drone has an API that let's you control not only the drone's movement but also stream video and images from both of its cameras. I'll show you how you can use Python and node.js to build a drone that moves all by itself.",

  "description": "PyData DC 2016\n\nLending involves risk and in order to be a successful lender at scale that risk needs to be mitigated. We'll be discussing how C2FO has built a suite of risk management tools for underwriting and portfolio management using the PyData ecosystem, rpy2 (for integrating R), and Spyre (for building a simple web application).\n\nEngineering a sophisticated in-house risk management solution for a commercial lending platform doesn't necessarily need to involve millions of lines of low-level code, clunky desktop applications, fancy front-end development, or messy spreadsheets. That is, so long as the problem is approached objectively and the solutions are evaluated critically.",

  "description": "PyData DC 2016\n\nA step after trying to model Continuous variables from Regression models, lies a very rewarding problem of estimating decisions which more lie in the discrete domain. In this talk, we work towards developing Logistic models to predict traffic for Capital Bikeshare, and work towards finding optimal station locations for Network expansion.",

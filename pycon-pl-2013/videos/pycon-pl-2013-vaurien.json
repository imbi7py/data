  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Vaurien\nPrelegent/Speaker: Tarek Ziad\u00e9\n\nVaurien is basically a Chaos Monkey for your TCP connections. Vaurien acts as a proxy between your web application and any backend. You can use it in your functional tests or even on a real deployment, to slow down/break/error out the requests and responses between your web application and a back end like LDAP, MySQL, Memcache, Redis and so on. This is very useful to check how your application behaves when something is wrong with your backend. So instead of having to deal with it live in production - just have a test continuously testing various scenarii. Vaurien is built in Python and you can write your own\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2013/pl/agenda",

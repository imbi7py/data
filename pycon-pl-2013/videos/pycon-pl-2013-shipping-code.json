In this talk I'll guide you through how we managed to build a world-class startup, implement a full-fledged SOA architecture, how we managed our growth and how we maintain a stable product while deploying to production around 20 times a day, how we ship code, work hard and stay happy.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2013/pl/agenda",

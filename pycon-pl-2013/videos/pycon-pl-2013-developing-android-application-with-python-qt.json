  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Developing Android application with Python & Qt\nPrelegent/Speaker: Martin Kolman\n\nAndroid applications have been traditionally made using a custom Java flavor with the option for C++ extensions. During the talk I'll describe and demonstrate how it is possible to create applications for Android in Python & Qt for the GUI, without the need for touching Java or C++. Such Python GUI applications can also be packaged as a standalone Android AP package, that can be even distributed through the the official Google Play store.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2013/pl/agenda",

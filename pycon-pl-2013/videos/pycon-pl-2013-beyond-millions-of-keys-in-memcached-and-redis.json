  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Beyond millions of keys in memcached and redis\nPrelegent/Speaker: Krzysztof Dorosz\n\nI will discus some advanced techniques that can be used to squeeze the last bit from memcached and redis when dealing with a very large scale. Talk will describe internal structure of memcached memory management and how to optimize configuration to a given use case. In terms of Redis some techniques of efficient hash store will be presented.\n\nDisclaimer: this talk has a very little in common with Python itself, but some examples are provided in Python, as well as both memcached and redis are industry standard for Python based projects. This is the same talk I gave for a very small audience of Pykonik (Krak\u00f3w python group).\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2013/pl/agenda",

  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Advanced Python through Django: Metaclasses\nPrelegent/Speaker: Peter Inglesby\n\nThe Django source code contains many advanced features of the Python language that are rarely encountered in day-to-day development work. This can make the Django source seem daunting to the uninitiated. In this talk I will take one particular advanced feature -- metaclasses -- and explain what they are and how they work, taking my examples from the Django codebase. We'll also cover, in passing, some techniques I've found useful for understanding a complex codebase. The talk will be suitable for anybody who has both a good grounding in the Python language, and a sense of curiosity.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2013/pl/agenda",

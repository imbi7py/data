  "summary": "The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach all women (including\ntrans women) and their friends who are looking to learn how to program\nin a friendly non-alpha-geek environment. The material on the\n`http://pystar.org <http://pystar.org/>`__ site was originally developed\nby the Boston Python Workshop which was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently\nPyStar events use a mix of badges from the PyStar site and their own\ncurriculum. As this project continues hopefully this site will be a hub\nof learning materials geared at all levels of Python learners, with a\nfocus on teaching people in a safe and supportive manner.\n",

  "summary": "This is a two part class aimed at expanding a developer's toolset with\nboth tmux and IPython. In the first half, we will learn about tmux. I\nwill first explain its client-server model and general architecture,\ncompare it to GNU screen, and show some use cases. Then, we will start\nusing it, create a customized profile, and solve a simple distributed\ncomputing problem with tmux. In the second half of this class, we will\nstart using IPython. I will first explain what it is and review\ndifferent use cases. Then, we will start using some basic commands,\ncustomize our profile and aliases, integrate python and shell scripting\ninto the same code, and, time permitting, see some of the interactive\nscientific computing and interactive distributed computing\npossibilities. If you have one, bring a laptop with tmux and IPython\nalready installed.\n",

  "description": "PyDX 2016 talk by Heidi Waterhouse\n\nI don't code. But I do study the methods languages use to think about themselves. Python has an iterative garbage collection that moves things into increasingly \"old\"/irrelevant buckets, until they are re-used or deleted.\n\nWhat if we applied that to more than just code? What if we expanded it to my old foe, wiki pages?\n\nJoin me for an engaging exploration of what code can teach us about documentation and executive function.",

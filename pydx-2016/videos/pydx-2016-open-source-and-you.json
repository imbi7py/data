These days maintainers and community managers are taking a more proactive role in setting the tone, building communities that are more productive and inclusive.\n\nBut culture change must come from the bottom up as much as the top down. In this talk I highlight salient problems and share solutions that everyone can pursue to shape the communities to which they belong.\"",

  "description": "PyDX 2016 talk by Terian Koscik\n\nOver the past year, the Portland chapter of Django Girls has helped nearly a hundred women build their first Django app. Through coaching and organizing at these workshops, I've learned a lot about how a programming teacher can be an encouraging (or discouraging) presence for newcomers. I'll share examples of my experiences volunteering with Django Girls, and discuss strategies for creating a supportive learning environment for new programmers.",

  "description": "PyDX tutorial by Hailey Buckingham\n\nYou should come to this tutorial if you are interested in finding out what machine learning is all about, and how to begin using it in your python projects. Attendees should have some experience with python, and be familiar with some algebra but you don't have to be a guru at either one!\n\nYou will come away with an introductory understanding of what machine learning is and the problems it can be used to solve, as well as some basic steps for setting up basic machine learning tools in your python projects.\n\nWe'll be using SciPy and Scikit-learn to walk through some basic machine learning tasks on several small data sets.",

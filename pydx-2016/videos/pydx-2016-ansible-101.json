  "description": "PyDX 2016 talk by Josh Berkus\n\nWanna use an automation platform written in Python? Of course you do. And I say \"automation platform\" rather than \"configuration management\" because Ansible isn't just about configuration.\n\nThis all-demo, no-slide talk will teach you by example how to get started with Ansible automating all the things you need automated.",

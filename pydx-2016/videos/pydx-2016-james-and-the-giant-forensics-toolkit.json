  "description": "PyDX 2016 talk by Tiberius Hefflin\n\nDigital forensics would be a whole different ballgame without Python - the basis for most of the tools used. But what do these tools do, and why are they so important? This talk looks to teach a little about digital forensics, and then use that as a springboard to discuss the importance of Python in the field.\n\nContent warning: talk includes reference to murder, child abuse, terrorism, and porn.",

  "description": "Over the last few years SSL/TLS encryption of not only websites but many other services as well has risen tremendously. The Let\u2019s Encrypt organization and certificate authority (CA) makes that pretty easy. Since September 2015 more than 10 million certificates have been issued. And you can use it, too. For free!In this talk I'll give a quick introduction how SSL/TLS works. I\u2019ll briefly layout the Let's Encrypt ACME protocol and explain what you need to make use of it. I will then give some examples of how to use SSL in Python while not shooting yourself in the foot or knee.",

  "description": "In 2010 Divio, the company behind djangoCMS started to develop djangoSHOP. Now after two years of silence, a new version of djangoSHOP is back, offering a REST API and a Finite State Machine for programmable workflows. Nevertheless djangoSHOP aims to be a minimalistic, but feature complete e-commerce framework, applying modern concepts such as Atomic Web Design as propagated by Brad Frost. This shifts page centric development with Models, Views and Templates to component based development using Models, Serializers and Atoms or Molecules.",

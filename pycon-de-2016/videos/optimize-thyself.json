  "description": "There\u2019s a ton of digital ink spent on the subject of productivity. Choosing the right tools, the right editor, the right plugins, the right OS, mapping keyboard shortcuts, using mouse gestures, the list goes on and on.\nThis is not what this talk is about! It\u2019s about everything else around your computer that can boost or kill your productivity. It\u2019s about efficient communication, getting things done, working less while doing more, sleeping good, keeping your blood sugar at optimal levels, and ultimately, staying healthy.\nHow should I know? I\u2019m juggling my time between my lifetime addiction to windsurfing , being a father and running a successful Python shop. My working time is very limited and I need to make the most of it. In this talk I\u2019ll go through what works for me and point to research on the subject.",

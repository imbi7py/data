  "description": "Modern version control: Mercurial internals\n\nPresented by Dirkjan Ochtman\n\nIn this talk, I'd like to talk a bit about Mercurial. This will not be a\nbeginner-level talk on DVCS or hg; it aims to be a higher-level\ndiscussion of the concepts employed in Mercurial. After having discussed\nthese, I'd also like to compare Mercurial and git based on UI,\nperformance and underlying concepts.\n",

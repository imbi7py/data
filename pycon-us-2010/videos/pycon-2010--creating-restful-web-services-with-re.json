  "description": "Creating RESTful Web Services with restish\n\nPresented by Grig Gheorghiu\n\nRoy Fielding described REST in his Ph.D. dissertation in the year 2000.\nAlmost ten years later, Web developers are still confused as to how to\napply the REST principles in their applications. Examples of poorly\ndesigned 'REST' APIs abound, and I will make use of them in my talk.\n\nIn this presentation, I will give an overview of REST and its design\nprinciples, and I will show a concrete example of a RESTful Web service\nimplemented in the restish framework. My examples will include CRUD\noperations, as well as transactions. I will also show how to consume\nthis Web service using both httplib2 and curl. I would be remiss if I\ndidn't describe ways to test the Web service with WebTest and twill.\n",

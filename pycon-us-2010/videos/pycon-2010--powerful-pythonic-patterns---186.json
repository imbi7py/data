  "description": "Powerful Pythonic Patterns video\n\nPresented by Alex Martelli\n\nAn extremely misguided meme is going around: that Python doesn't have,\nor need, any Design Patterns. Maybe the meme springs from not realizing\nwhat the Gang Of Four state so plainly in their historical \"Design\nPatterns\" book: which design patterns are useful DOES depend on the\nprogramming language one targets -- design is NOT independent of\nimplementation, as the epic-fail \"Waterfall\" Methodology Pattern would\nsuggest. If you examine a \"classic DP\" that's basically a workaround for\nsome other language's lack of garbage collection, or for a clumsy\nstatic-typing system, it may indeed be worthless for Python. But many\nother DPs are still perfectly useful and applicable, and indeed Python's\nstrengths as a language afford riffing on them to develop highly\nPythonic, powerful, productive variants.\n\nIn this talk, I analyze some of my favorite pattern families -- e.g.,\nTemplate Method and its variants, Dependency Injection and its ilk,\nCallback and friends -- in a highly Pythonic context. Non-pattern\nIdioms, and Patterns that aren't really Design Patterns but rather\nArchitecture or Methodology ones, also make cameo appearances.\n",

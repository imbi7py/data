Why do you need to shard your data? lots of data lots of writes\n\n2. What should you do before sharding?\n   Scale up - throw money at it. Feature partitioning - split feature data on different databases\n   Sharded databases.\n\n3.  How to set up multiple databases in Django tools that we used at Wave. Talk about what Django gives us right out of the box (DB Routers) How database routers work. Gotchas when using South for DB migrations.\n\n4.  The downsides of multi-database systems. what we lose (ForeignKeys, Transactions management, select\\_related(), prefetch\\_related())\n\n5.  Scaling the database via sharding. what does this mean? how do I pick a key to shard on? what makes a good and bad sharding key?\n\n6.  Database routers for sharding.\n\n7.

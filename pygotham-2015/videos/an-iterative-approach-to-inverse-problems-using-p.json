  "description": "This is a talk about inverse problems and improving on past algorithms\nthat have focused on inverse problems in math, data science, tomography,\nand image processing. We use a new iterative method coded in Python's\nNumpy and show it's ability to recover images compared to previous\napproaches.\n",

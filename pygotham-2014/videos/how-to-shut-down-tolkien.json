  "description": "While Tolkien had friends who could devise ingenious ways to critique\nhis work without sounding critical, he had others whose remarks were\nmerciless and direct \u2014 to the point that Tolkien simply stopped sharing\nnew chapters as he wrote The Lord of the Rings. As programmers we share\nmany of the struggles of writers and artists, and we often react just as\nbadly to critique of our code. From Tolkien\u2019s experience we will draw\nlessons about how to make critique generous instead of damaging, and\nactionable instead of personal.\n",

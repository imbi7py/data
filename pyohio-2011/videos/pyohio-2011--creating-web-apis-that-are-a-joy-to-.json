  "description": "Creating Web APIs that are a joy to use\n\nPresented by Issac Kelly\n\nIssac is an avid API consumer. He&aposll cover how to make an API that\nis not terrible. This is apparently very difficult to do, and many\nanti-patterns will be shown. No care will be taken to protect the\nguilty. This talk is not as focused on Python, as it is on creating Web\nAPIs, and an understanding of HTTP is assumed.\n",

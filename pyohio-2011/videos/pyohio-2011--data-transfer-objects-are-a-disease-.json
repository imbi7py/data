  "description": "Data-Transfer Objects are a Disease. Meet the Cure.\n\nPresented by Aaron Oliver\n\nData Transfer Objects (DTOs) are commonplace. Every time you want to\nshuffle data and be object-oriented about it, you crank out a new class.\nBut then someone extends it for their purposes. Badly. Then someone ELSE\nextends it AGAIN and makes thing worse. Learn what makes our brains want\nto create DTOs, how they've been (ab)used in the past, and how Python's\nnamedtuple makes it all better.\n",

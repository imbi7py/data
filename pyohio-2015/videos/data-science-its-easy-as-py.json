  "description": "Over the last several years, many amazing Python projects have been\ncreated for working with data, making Python one of the top languages\nfor data scientists. In this talk, I'll cover all five stages of the\nOSEMN data science process, and several Python libraries that can be\nused at each stage. To demo, I'll illustrate the creation of a language\nclassification algorithm, using Wikipedia articles.\n",

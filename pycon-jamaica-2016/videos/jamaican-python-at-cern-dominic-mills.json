  "description": "Dominic Mills presents on his work with the Large Hadron Collider. Some objectives of the project included:\nIntegrating the Celery library to manage data received from the sensors in a distributed asynchronous manner.\nIntegrating the Bokeh library to produce real-time plots from the asynchronous data read from the sensors.\nImplementing functionality to trigger alarms in case of any faulty hardware.\nCreating a language agnostic description of the hardware with XML.\n\nhttps://www.pythonjam.org.jm/conference-2016 the PyCon Jamaica 2016 technology conference for Python software developers was held (November 17 - 18, 2016).  The conference was immediately followed by the Great Python Scavenger Hunt https://www.pythonjam.org.jm/conference-2016/scavenger-race. Our conferences are open to beginners, experts and non-programmers.",

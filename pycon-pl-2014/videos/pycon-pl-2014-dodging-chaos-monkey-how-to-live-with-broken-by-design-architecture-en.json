Things breaks. No matter how expensive hardware was, it will break one day, only question is whether or not you replace it before it happens. Not always you will. To make truly fault tolerant and high available systems it requires not only ops effort, but devs as well. We need to learn how to write systems in HA. This talk will show you few problems and solutions to do so.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

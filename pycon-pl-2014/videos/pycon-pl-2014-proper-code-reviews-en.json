Ask a guy that has been doing code reviews for a whole team of programmers for the last year. That's me! Let me tell you about the tools I use, my approach to code reviews. Let me give examples of bad review and good review. Let me give you pointers: what to look at in detail, what kind of feedback the other developers might appreciate.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

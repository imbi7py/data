  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Good RESTful API documentation is executable\nPrelegent/Speaker: Wojtek Erbetowski\n\nHow do you keep your REST API documented? Online description? Or maybe a spreadsheet/doc? Think about how does your consumer discover it. Poor one is pasting URLs to curl or POSTman, right? And he\u2019s mad as hell, as documentation is out of sync with code as soon as it\u2019s written. Not to mention submitting bugs looks like an email ping-pong. It\u2019s not 2010 any more, you know? Let\u2019s jump into cool tools that will improve your consumers\u2019 life and save you some time.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

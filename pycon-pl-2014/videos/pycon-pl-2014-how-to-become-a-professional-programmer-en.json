  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: How to become a professional programmer\nPrelegent/Speaker: Radomir Dopieralski\n\nProfessional programming is not just about the code that you write. It's also about the habits, the attitude, the tools and the processes. It's not always necessary or even desirable to behave professionally, but it certainly is useful to know how to do it when you have to. I will tell you about some of the tools that are indispensable for a professional Python programmer, and I will try to show you how they, together with the right processes, can improve the solutions you make.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

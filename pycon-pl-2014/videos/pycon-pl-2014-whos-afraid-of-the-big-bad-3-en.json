  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: Who's afraid of the Big Bad 3?\nPrelegent/Speaker: Lennart Regebro\n\nPython 3 is often described in scary words, with claims like it being another language and that is is tearing the community in two etc. If you believe what some people are saying, it's slow, it's a nightmare, porting is a pain and you are gonna get eaten alive! The truth is much less frightening, and this talk will take a high level perspective of Python 3, and look at my and others experience with supporting it and tell you how you can switch to Python 3.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

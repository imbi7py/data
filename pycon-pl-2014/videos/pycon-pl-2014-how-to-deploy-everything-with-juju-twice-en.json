  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: How to deploy everything with Juju, twice\nPrelegent/Speaker: Wes Mason\n\nWanna deploy an app? How about a whole cluster of services? Let me show you how I can deploy an app, infrastructure and an OpenStack cluster 20 times a day, with some Python, some YAML, and a bit of Juju. Juju is an open source service orchestration framework/toolkit which allow you to work with services just as that: services, leaving much of the mundane details of infrastructure and deployment to it.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

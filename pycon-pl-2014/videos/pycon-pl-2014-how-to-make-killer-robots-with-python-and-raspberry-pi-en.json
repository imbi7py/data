  "description": "Tytu\u0142/Topic: How to make killer robots with Python and Raspberry Pi\nPrelegent/Speaker: Radomir Dopieralski\n\nKubik is a quadruped robot build around a Raspberry Pi. I will tell you what I learned, what challenges I encoutered building it. I will also tell you how I used the PyGame library to program in. If everything works, you will get to see the robot in action. Survivors will be assimilated.\n\nhttp://pl.pycon.org/2014/pl/agenda",

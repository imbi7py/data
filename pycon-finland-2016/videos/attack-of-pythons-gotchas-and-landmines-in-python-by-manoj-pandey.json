  "description": "Attack of Pythons : Gotchas and Landmines in Python by Manoj Pandey\n\nPython may be one of the simplest and most flexible programming languages out there, but it is still a programming language. It still has syntax, datatypes, and some occasional dark corners. Python \"\"warts\"\" are things for which people have criticised Python, typically aspects of the language or mechanisms of its implementation, because such aspects either expose certain surprising inconsistencies, are regarded as omissions, or cause irritation for parts of the community in some sense.\n\nThis talk will be about common pitfalls (termed warts/landmines) that people face using Python programming language.\n\nAbout the author: Manoj Pandey is a rising CS junior, who speaks Python primarily and worked with SquadRun's Engineering Team this summer. Before this he was a Data Analytics Intern at Inspiration Edge and Zouk Fellow at ZoukLoans. He is an avid FOSS enthusiast and Pythonista, almost all of his projects are open-sourced on Github (manojpandey).",

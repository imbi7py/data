  "description": "ZODB \u2013 the Python database by Asko Soukka\n\nZODB is a mature and well maintained object-oriented database for transparently and persistently storing Python object trees (objects and their references). In other words, ZODB stores Python objects as they are \u2013 no object-relational mapping required. In addition to Python objects, ZODB can also store binary blobs (like images) attached to those objects.\n\nI give a small tutorial on getting started with ZODB with a simple command-line app written in Python 3. I cover the basic ZODB usage, testing and maintenance. Finally, I give a short overview of the ZODB ecosystem and demo of SubstanceD \u2013 a ZODB embracing web app framework.\n\nAbout the author: Asko Soukka is a system designer at University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and a core contributor for Plone - an open source CMS written in Python.

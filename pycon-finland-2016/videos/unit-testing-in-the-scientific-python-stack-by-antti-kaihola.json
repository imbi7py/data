  "description": "Unit testing in the Scientific Python stack by Antti Kaihola\n\nWriting unit tests for algorithms and data processing pipelines poses challenges distinct from those in the web or desktop application domain. A key reason for poor unit test coverage is that writing tests is hard and laborious.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show some real-life unit test scenarios from Eniram along with tools we have developed to ease writing good tests. Many of the presented techniques also apply in other domains besides data processing.\n\nTopics will include some or all of:\n\nshort overview of NumPy and Pandas testing tools\nEniram's testing tools for\nasserting vector data\nenhanced parametrized tests\ntwo-dimensional parametrized tests\nasserting mixed values and exceptions\nreadable diffs for text block assertions\ndiscovery of configurations and input data for running data processing tests\n\n\nAbout the author: Antti Kaihola is a Python developer working in the Infrastructure team at Eniram. He's been with Python for 17 years, first for web development and scripting before moving into data processing. Building a platform for data processing using great Open Source components keeps Antti and his colleagues busy at work. At home, he occasionally spices family life with a microcontroller here and some MicroPython there, or encourages his kids to experiment with programming and robotics.",

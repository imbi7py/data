  "description": "FP in Python: it's simpler than you thought by Dmitry Dolgov\n\nFunctional programming is a quite popular paradigm nowadays, but it suffers from a lot of myths and misunderstandings around it. And one of them is that functional programming can be applied only in few special languages, which is wrong. This paradigm is just a language agnostic way of thinking about your code. We will discuss pros and cons of applying it in case of Python:\n\nWhy do anyone need this at all?\nSince Python is a multi-paradigm language, what it already can provide\nfor FP?\nThird-party libraries for FP in Python\nAbout the author: Dmitry Dolgov is a Passionate Python developer at Mindojo, PhD student, with interest in Haskell and experience in PostgreSQL development.",

It's actually surprisingly simple.\n\nJoin me for a tour around the codebase of Dirigible, the Pythonic spreadsheet (recently rescued from its abandonware status and made open source).\n\nFind out how cell formulae are parsed and evaluated to become cell values, how the dependency graph of the spreadsheet is built, and how custom python code can be merged into spreadsheet calculations without everything exploding violently.",

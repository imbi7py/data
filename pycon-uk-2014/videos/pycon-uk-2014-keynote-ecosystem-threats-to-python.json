  "description": "Presented by: Van Lindberg.\n\nFriday morning keynote.\n\nPython is a spectacular success - far more than anyone, even Guido, would have anticipated 20 years ago. Python is preinstalled on almost every operating system, is becoming the lingua franca for many numeric, statistical, and big data problems, and is the default teaching language in many colleges and universities.\n\nBut our success does not hide the warning signs. Javascript, Julia, Java, Lua, and Go are all picking up speed and mindshare, frequently at the expense of Python. What do these languages and language communities have that is enticing others to pick them? How can we learn from the good ideas in these languages to make Python even stronger? How can we interoperate and build on what they have?",

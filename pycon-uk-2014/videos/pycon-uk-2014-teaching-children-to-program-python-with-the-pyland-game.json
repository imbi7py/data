  "description": "Presented by: Alex Bradbury\n\nThis summer, a team of interns at the University of Cambridge Computer Lab have been working on a project to teach children to program in Python through a programming game. The primary target platform is the Raspberry Pi, though multi-platform ports are planned for the future. It is, of course, open source. The game consists of a number of challenges and puzzles which invite the user to apply programming techniques in order to progress. I will discuss the motivation for the game, give a demo, give some insight into its implementation, our plans for the future, and how you can get involved.",
